# Hero Image Prompts - Upgrade Documentation

## Changes Made

Upgraded image generation prompts from basic descriptions to professional, AI-optimized hero image prompts suitable for high-quality image generation.

## Before vs After

### Before (Basic Prompt)
```
Professional product photo of The Bottle Beacon: Simple Edison bulb light fixture. 
Made from glass bottle, cord, bulb. Style: minimalist. High quality, sustainable design.
```

**Issues:**
- Too generic and brief
- No composition or lighting details
- Same prompt structure for all styles
- Not optimized for AI image generation

### After (Hero Prompt)
```
Hero product photography of The Bottle Beacon: This project focuses on a clean, 
minimalist aesthetic by cutting the bottom off a glass bottle and fitting it with 
a simple Edison bulb and cord set.

MATERIALS: Crafted from upcycled glass bottle, cord, bulb, showcasing sustainable 
design and creative reuse.

STYLE: Minimalist aesthetic - clean lines, simple geometry, monochromatic palette, 
negative space

COMPOSITION: centered, balanced, uncluttered background, sharp focus, professional 
product photography, 8K resolution, ultra-detailed

LIGHTING: soft natural lighting, subtle shadows, bright and airy, professional 
studio quality

MOOD: serene, elegant, modern, eco-friendly, artisanal craftsmanship

QUALITY: Magazine-quality hero image, commercial photography, photorealistic 
rendering, sharp focus throughout, professional color grading

CONTEXT: Sustainable upcycling project, waste-to-value transformation, 
environmentally conscious design
```

## Style-Specific Enhancements

## Technical Details

### PR1 Node (Prompt Builder)
- Enhanced to generate detailed prompts for all 3 concepts
- Style-specific dictionaries for consistent styling
- Dynamic material insertion from user's ingredients
- Professional photography terminology

### IMG Node (Image Generation)
- Now labeled as "HERO image generation"
- Logs show detailed prompts being used
- Image IDs prefixed with `hero_` instead of `generated_`
- Metadata includes `quality: "hero"` flag

### Files Modified

1. **`backend/app/workflows/phase3_nodes.py`**
   - Lines 180-242: Enhanced PR1 prompt builder
   - Lines 255-260: Updated IMG node description
   - Lines 271-310: Enhanced image generation with hero quality
   - Lines 340-348: Added prompt logging
   - Lines 382-390: Hero quality metadata

## AI Image Generation Integration

These prompts are now ready for professional AI image generation services:

### Recommended: Google Imagen 3
```python
from google.cloud.aiplatform import ImageGenerationModel

model = ImageGenerationModel.from_pretrained("imagegeneration@006")
images = model.generate_images(
    prompt=variant.image_prompt,  # Our detailed hero prompt
    number_of_images=1,
    aspect_ratio="1:1",
    safety_filter_level="block_some"
)
image_url = images[0].url
```

### Alternative: OpenAI DALL-E 3
```python
import openai

response = await openai.Image.acreate(
    model="dall-e-3",
    prompt=variant.image_prompt,  # Our detailed hero prompt
    size="1024x1024",
    quality="hd",  # Use HD quality for hero images
    n=1
)
image_url = response.data[0].url
```

### Alternative: Stability AI SDXL
```python
import stability_sdk

response = stability_api.generate(
    prompt=variant.image_prompt,  # Our detailed hero prompt
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    steps=50,  # More steps for hero quality
    cfg_scale=7.5
)
```

## Placeholder Image Updates

Until real AI generation is integrated, placeholders now reflect hero quality:

- Image IDs: `hero_{thread_id}_{style}_{timestamp}`
- Metadata includes `quality: "hero"`
- Aesthetic score: 0.9 (up from 0.8)
- Mode: `"hero-placeholder"` or `"hero-generated"`

## Expected Quality Improvements

When integrated with real AI image generation:

### Visual Quality
- âœ… 8K resolution capability
- âœ… Professional product photography composition
- âœ… Style-consistent lighting and mood
- âœ… Photorealistic rendering
- âœ… Commercial/magazine quality output

### Consistency
- âœ… All 3 concepts get equal quality treatment
- âœ… Style-appropriate aesthetics
- âœ… Sustainable/eco-friendly visual themes
- âœ… Professional color grading

### User Experience
- âœ… Impressive hero images for selection
- âœ… Clear visual differentiation between styles
- âœ… Professional presentation
- âœ… Build confidence in project quality

## Testing

### Check Prompt Quality
```bash
# Check backend logs for generated prompts
docker-compose logs backend | grep "Using detailed prompt"

# You should see detailed multi-line prompts like:
# "Hero product photography of The Bottle Beacon..."
# "MATERIALS: Crafted from upcycled glass bottle..."
# etc.
```

### Verify Metadata
```bash
# Connect to Redis
docker exec -it <redis-container> redis-cli

# Get image metadata
GET image:hero_<thread_id>_minimalist_<timestamp>

# Should show:
# - "quality": "hero"
# - "prompt": <detailed prompt>
# - Full structured prompt content
```

## Cost Considerations

Hero-quality prompts with AI generation will have costs:

### Pricing Estimates (per image)
- **Imagen 3**: ~$0.02-0.04 per 1024x1024 image
- **DALL-E 3 HD**: ~$0.08 per 1024x1024 image  
- **Stability AI**: ~$0.002-0.01 per image

### Cost Management
- Only generate 3 images per session (one per concept)
- Cache aggressively in Redis (7200s TTL)
- Consider storing generated images in S3 for reuse
- Use safety filters to avoid regeneration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Prompts**: Learn from user selections to improve prompts
2. **Custom Styles**: Allow users to input style preferences
3. **Multiple Angles**: Generate 2-3 angles per concept
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Generate low-res preview, then high-res
5. **Negative Prompts**: Add negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements
