# Change Log: Agent QA & Testing Implementation

This document provides a detailed summary of the work done to design, implement, and debug a comprehensive testing framework for the AI Recycle-to-Market Generator.

---

## 1. Test Suite Implementation

A new testing suite was created within `backend/app/workflows/testing/` to ensure the agent's robustness and reliability. This suite is structured to cover different levels of testing:

- **`test_unit_nodes.py`**: This file focuses on **Unit Tests** for individual nodes within the LangGraph workflow. 
    - It tests nodes from Phase 1 (`ingredient_extraction_node`, `null_checker_node`, `ingredient_categorizer_node`) in isolation.
    - External dependencies, specifically the `call_gemini_with_retry` function, are mocked to verify that each node's internal logic processes state correctly and returns the expected output for a given input.

- **`test_integration_phases.py`**: This file contains **Integration Tests** to verify the seamless flow of data and state between nodes and across workflow phases.
    - It validates the full "Ingredient Discovery" pipeline (Phase 1), ensuring that ambiguous user input correctly triggers clarification loops.
    - It also tests the critical safety pathway in Phase 2, confirming that a project with dangerous materials is correctly identified and blocked by the `evaluation_node`.

- **`test_adversarial_cases.py`**: This file implements **Edge Case and Adversarial Tests** to probe the agent's resilience against unexpected or malicious inputs.
    - Scenarios include handling vague user input (e.g., "a pile of junk"), attempts at prompt injection, and requests to create projects from inherently dangerous materials (e.g., asbestos).

## 2. Environment & Dependency Management

A significant portion of the work involved stabilizing the testing environment.

- **`requirements.txt` Updates**: The file was updated to include the necessary libraries for the test suite:
    - `pytest`: The core testing framework.
    - `pytest-mock`: For creating mock objects and patching dependencies.
    - `pytest-asyncio`: To enable support for testing asynchronous code, as all workflow nodes are `async`.

- **Dependency Conflict Resolution**: A series of complex dependency conflicts were identified and resolved:
    1.  An initial `ImportError` for `Discriminator` from `pydantic` was traced to an incompatibility between `langchain-core` and the installed `pydantic` version.
    2.  After several attempts to downgrade, the root cause was found: `langchain-core==0.3.15` required `pydantic>=2.5.2`, while a newer `langchain-community==0.3.7` required `langchain-core>=0.3.17`. 
    3.  The conflict was resolved by upgrading `langchain-core` to `0.3.17` and ensuring `pydantic` was `>2.5.2`.
    4.  A subsequent `ModuleNotFoundError` for `langgraph.checkpoint.redis` was fixed by adding the new, separate `langgraph-checkpoint-redis` package.
    5.  A final conflict with `redis` was resolved by upgrading it to version `5.2.1` to satisfy the `langgraph-checkpoint-redis` dependency.

- **`pytest.ini` Creation**: A new configuration file was added to the `backend` directory. This file tells `pytest` where to find the tests (`testpaths = app/workflows/testing`) and configures the Python path, making the test suite easily runnable from the project root.

## 3. Application & Test Code Bug Fixes

Through the process of writing and running tests, several bugs and errors were uncovered and fixed:

- **Bug in Knowledge Base**: In `backend/app/knowledge/material_affordances.py`, an `AttributeError` was fixed by correcting a reference to a non-existent `MaterialType.STEEL` enum member to the correct `MaterialType.METAL`.

- **Incorrect Import Path**: In `backend/app/workflows/graph.py`, the import path for `RedisSaver` was updated from the old `langgraph.checkpoint.redis` to the new, correct `langgraph_checkpoint_redis` after its package structure was changed.

- **Test Refactoring for Asynchronous Code**: All test functions calling the `async` workflow nodes were converted to `async def` and marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`. All calls to node functions were updated to use `await`.

- **Corrected Mocking**: The initial tests incorrectly tried to patch a non-existent `gemini_client`. This was corrected to patch the actual function used for API calls: `app.workflows.nodes.call_gemini_with_retry`.

- **State Initialization Errors**: Tests were failing with `pydantic.ValidationError` because the mock state objects being passed to the workflow nodes were incomplete. The tests were fixed to provide the required `thread_id` and to use properly instantiated `WorkflowState` and `IngredientsData` objects instead of generic mocks.

- **Redis Mocking**: To prevent `ConnectionRefusedError` during tests, `redis_service` is now mocked in tests that don't require a real Redis instance.
